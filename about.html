      <h1>About Mercedes-AMG</h1>
      <p>
        Mercedes-AMG GmbH, commonly known as AMG, is the high-performance
        subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG. AMG independently hires engineers and
        contracts with manufacturers to customize Mercedes-Benz AMG vehicles.
        The company has its headquarters in Affalterbach, Baden-Württemberg,
        Germany. AMG was originally an independent engineering firm specializing
        in performance improvements for Mercedes-Benz vehicles. DaimlerChrysler
        AG took a controlling interest in 1999, then became the sole owner of
        AMG in 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH is now a wholly owned subsidiary of
        Mercedes-Benz AG, which is owned by Daimler AG. AMG models typically
        have more aggressive looks, a higher level of performance, better
        handling, better stability and more extensive use of carbon fibre than
        their regular Mercedes-Benz counterparts. AMG models are typically the
        most expensive and highest-performing variant of each Mercedes-Benz
        class. AMG variants are usually badged with two numerals, as opposed to
        regular Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which have three (e.g. "C 63" as opposed
        to "C 320"). The numerals do not always indicate engine size, but are
        rather a tribute to earlier heritage cars, such as the 300 SEL 6.3
        litre. For example, newer-model AMG V8s such as the C 63 actually have
        4.0L V8s. The world's first stand alone Mercedes-AMG dealership, AMG
        Sydney, was opened in Sydney, Australia in 2018.
